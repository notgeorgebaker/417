Bioinformatics tools for bench scientists who are a little unfamiliar with coding.

We can accept no liability for the quality of the tools provided herein 

The services provided by the uploaded codes are to assist in the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. To better understand the movement
and interactions between proteins; either in solution or embedded in membrane. 

I'm new to all this stuff myself, and so some codes will be a little clunky to the more experianced person.
